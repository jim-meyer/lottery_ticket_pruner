TO DO
-----
Implement same-sign pruning
Run cifar100_reduced_10x_100_epochs 5x and average results
Implement inside my training pipeline to see if pruning results for DNNs show promise
Address all outstanding TODOs
Make sure things work with TF2
Finish README
Use github to build upon pushes?
Post package to pypi
    https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/


DONE
----
Get "pip install" working
    - Basic install
    - Create wheel
    - Add testing support
Enable code coverage report generation
Find better solution than passing around 2 different kinds of prune functions (local and global)
Inspect code coverage misses
Make sure unit tests pass reliably even after multiple invocations
Make sure code can be imported intelligently. "import lottery_ticker_pruner; ltp = LotteryTicketPruner(model)"
Make sure we're doing logging in interesting places
Document the code thoroughly
Figure out why tox isn't showing proper code coverage numbers but `pytest --cov=lottery_ticket_pruner --cov-branch --cov-append --cov-report=term --pyargs lottery_ticket_pruner tests` is
Add copyrights to code
Create example (using MNIST?)
