TO DO
-----
Make sure code can be imported intelligently. "import lottery_ticker_pruner; ltp = LotteryTicketPruner(model)"
Make sure we're doing logging in interesting places
Make sure things work with TF2
Make sure unit tests pass reliably even after multiple invocations
Document the code thoroughly
Finish README
Add copyrights to code
Use github to build upon pushes?
Create example (using MNIST?)
Post package to pypi
    https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/


DONE
----
Get "pip install" working
    - Basic install
    - Create wheel
    - Add testing support
Enable code coverage report generation
Find better solution than passing around 2 different kinds of prune functions (local and global)
Inspect code coverage misses
