# Lottery Ticket Pruner

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can often benefit from "pruning" some weights in the network, turning dense matrices of weights
into sparse matrices of weights with little or no loss in accuracy of the overall model. *In fact, these pruned networks
often times result in better model accuracy!*
