# This file contains the high level dependencies needed for tensorflow 2.x support
# This file is intended to be used to create a frozen set of dependencies. Each time
# this file changes one should:
#   virtualenv <new env dir>
#   <new env dir>/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements_tf2.txt
#   pip freeze > requirements_tf2_frozen.txt
# Then when doing 'pip install -r ...' the *_frozen.txt file should be used.
# This helps keep builds reproducible. And avoids breakages if/when new versions
# of dependent packages, direct or indirect, are released that have incompatibilities.
